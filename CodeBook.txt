This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
===================================================================
The data source:  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

====================================================================
Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
====================================================================
  Working Assumptions:
 1) The number of variables of interest is 33 please refer features_info.txt
   The mean and std of the 33 variables need to summarized for each activity and subject.    
   Specifically, the needed variables are: 
     1.  tBodyAcc-mean()-X
     2.  tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
     3.  tBodyAcc-mean()-Z

 2) Before merging the test and training data sets, the activity and the subject has to be added to the data sets. As there is no matching involved, rbind will be used to "merge"
 3) Cleanup of the variable names in the features.txt file (duplication of Body)
 4) Give descriptive names to the activities 
 5) Give descriptive names to variables
